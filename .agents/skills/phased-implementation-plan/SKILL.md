# Phased Implementation Plan

## Instructions

When asked to create a phased implementation plan, generate a detailed Markdown file containing a sequence of logically self-contained phases. Each phase represents a **single git commit**.

Follow these core principles to ensure the PR commits read like a story and are polite to the reviewer:

1. **Single Operation per Commit**: Each commit must focus on exactly one thing (e.g., add a new feature, modify a specific part, refactor). Never combine multiple unrelated changes.
2. **Rule of Thumb**: If the changes cannot be described in a single commit message sentence, they must be broken down into smaller commits.
3. **Introduce, Use, Remove**:
    - Introduce a new concept/component, expose it, add its tests in one commit.
    - Use it in a separate commit.
    - Optionally remove the old concept/component in a separate commit.
4. **Always Compile**: Each phase must describe changes that will compile successfully. For example, if an interface is modified, all of its usages must be updated in the exact same phase.
5. **Logical Flow**: Commits should flow naturally from one to the next, building up the feature step-by-step like a story. Avoid front-loading all additions (e.g., creating 5 new components in 5 consecutive commits before using any of them). Instead, interleave additions, usages, and cleanups to maintain a clear, understandable progression.

## Output Format

Write the detailed plan to a new Markdown file (e.g., `docs/phased-plan-<feature>.md`).

```markdown
# Phased Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

Overal feature description, purpose, goal etc.. (make sure it's complete and self-contained)

## Phase 1: [Short, single-sentence commit message]

-   **Goal**: [What this phase achieves]
-   **Steps**:
    how to implement this phase: include (when necessary) code snipts, type definitions, files to change etc.. (it's meant as a lightweight guide)
-   **Validation**: [How to ensure it works: compile? tests successful?]

## Phase 2: [Short, single-sentence commit message]

...
```
